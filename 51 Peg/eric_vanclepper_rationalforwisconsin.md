My research would be a great fit with Ke Zhang at the University of Wisconsin Madison. Her research on chemical evolution in disks is the ideal observational counterpart to my theoretical modeling work on the impacts of dust evolution on chemistry throughout a disk's lifetime.

Other people that would be good are Susanna Widicus Weaver, expert in laboratory ice experiments relevent to my research aims. Thomas Beatty and Juliet Becker will also be good resources in their knowledge of exoplanet atmospheres and dynamics, respectively. Additionally, the new WICOR center is a great resource for continuing my origin of life work.

UW Madison has the CHTC, which offers High Performance Computing including GPUs, which drastically speed up computation and make these simulations feasable. There is also an example [here](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/cite-chtc.html) of what I can put in my grant brought to you by the CHTC.

Finally, for broader impacts WISCIENCE provides resources to improve science teaching skills.
